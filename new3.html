    <h1>5 ways to treat Hyperthyroidism in cats - Are they effective?</h1>
      <img src="Pic\new3p1.jpg" id="picnew">
    <p>Hyperthyroidism is a common disease in cats, and mostly afflicts cats middle-aged and older. Also called thyrotoxicosis, hyperthyroidism is caused by an increase in production of thyroid hormones (known as T3 and T4) from an enlarged thyroid gland in a cat’s neck. In most cases, enlargement of thyroid glands is caused by a non-cancerous tumor called an adenoma. Some rare cases of hyperthyroid disease are caused by malignant tumors known as thyroid adenocarcinomas. Although the cause of feline hyperthyroidism is not known, possible contributing factors include deficiencies or excesses of certain compounds in the diet and chronic exposure to thyroid-disrupting chemicals in food or the environment.</p>
    <h2>Clinical Signs</h2>
      <img src="Pic\catnew3.jpg" id="picnew">
    <p>Cats afflicted with hyperthyroidism usually develop a variety of signs that may be subtle at first but that become more severe as the disease progresses. The most common clinical signs of hyperthyroidism are weight loss, increased appetite, and increased thirst and urination. Hyperthyroidism may also cause vomiting, diarrhea, and hyperactivity. The coat of affected cats may appear unkempt, matted, or greasy</p>
    <p>Occasionally, a cat suspected of having hyperthyroidism has a TT4 level within the upper range of normal. When this occurs, a second test, usually a free T4 by equilibrium dialysis (FT4 by ED) or a T3 suppression test, is performed. If these tests are not diagnostic, a thyroid scan (thyroid scintigraphy) can be performed at a veterinary referral center, or the TT4 can be measured again in a few weeks.</p>
    <h2>Treatment</h2>
    <p>There are four treatment options for feline hyperthyroidism: medication, radioactive iodine therapy, surgery, and dietary therapy. Each treatment option has its advantages and disadvantages. The treatment a cat receives for hyperthyroidism will depend on specific circumstances, including the patient’s overall health status, the owner’s ability and willingness to medicate the cat regularly, and financial considerations.</p>
